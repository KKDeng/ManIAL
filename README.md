 # Code of augmented Lagrangian method for nonsmooth problem on Riemannian manifold

Our code is based on "[manopt toolbox](https://www.manopt.org/index.html)" and code in paper "[Proximal Gradient Method for Nonsmooth Optimization over the Stiefel Manifold](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/18M122457X)"
